    "## Basic driving agent\n",

    "### Performance\n",
    "As expected, randomly choosing an action results in poor performance: the agent doesn't obey traffic rules, nor does it reach its destination in time. (At least most of the time.)"

    "## Choosing a set of states\n",
    "In order to create an agent which can behave in a more intelligent manner, a set of states must be identified. Ideally, these states should contain all of the necessary information about the world that is needed for choosing the correct action.\n",
    "I took a simple approach, and defined the states as unique permutations of the necessary input values, in the following order:\n",
    "1. The state of the traffic light (either 'green' or 'red')\n",
    "2. The direction the car in the oncoming lane is headed\\*\n",
    "3. The direction the car in the lane to the right is headed\\*\n",
    "4. The direction the car in the lane to the left is headed\\*\n",
    "5. The direction recommended by the route planner\n",
    "\n",
    "\\* (if there is no car there, the value is None)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for example, one of the states my agent can experience is ('green', None, None, None, 'left'). This results in a few superfluous states (e.g. because if the traffic light signals red, the car on the oncoming lane will always stop; the state ('red', 'forward', None, None, 'left') will never be visited in practice)."
